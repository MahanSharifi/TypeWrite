i'm writing this now because despite the clashes you and I have, I always know that you're the girl I want to tell everything too. 
You are the person that I want to tell all my good news and all my bad news. And I know this hump this past week,
I know we had to undergo it. I want us to embark on our journey knowing exactly what we mean to eachother and I 
do not want to wait anymore. Talia, I knew I would fall for you ever since your amazing smile and wave at the library.
I thought about you then constantly, and I do now aswell. You push me to think outside the box, and I have made goals 
and promises to you to be a better person. I hear your voice and I feel ecstacy. Food tastes better with you,
there is more motivation in the day with you, smiles are bigger with you. I want to be there for you, in moments of joy and times of blue.
I want to be their in your corner, backing you up, and pushing you to always put your best foot forward. When you and I hug, it is one
of my favourite things in the world, because you already know watermelon and that laugh of yours is #1 and #2.
I want more dinner, beach, movie, cooking, walks, bubble tea, drives, art gallery and many more dates with you. 
I want to make you feel even more special than you already know you are and I want to put a smile on your face the same way
you always put one on me. 

October 16, and we are on the train. You just said "are you going to show me something or can I sleep", and as I proceeded to work you go and watch
me with one eye open, you goof. Im trying to paint the scenery here. I have to talk in past tense as if I am in the future when I want to describe how beautiful you looked on the 
train. I cant be like you look so beautiful, i have to say you looked so beautiful. Anyways im rambling. I just wanted to say that even the simple task of training with you, makes me so happy.


Talia Dina Fiaani, will you be my amazing, gorgyyyy girlfriend?
